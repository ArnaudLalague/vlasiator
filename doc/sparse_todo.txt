-Add copy operators to spatial cell class. Now the copy boundary conditions are
disabled

-The sparse velocity dist does not change during simulation, should be adapted

-Load balancing during simualtion will require ne dccrg features and some work
(prepare to load balance)

-pressure datareducer not done

-Change project initialization logic so that project can directly put
 distribution values in the required locations. 



- Not that project cannot modify block parameters anymore (nothing sensible
  for them to do there) in calcBlockPaameter
