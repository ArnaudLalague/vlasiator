README file for vlasiator test package

Test package consists of three parts:
   1. settings for different computers
   2. settings for different tests
   3. running the tests
for the first two parts the scripts for short and medium test are separate.

1. Computer settings
   - files are named: short/medium_test_hermit.sh, this is the file that is submitted
   - in these files user can define settings for running the program
   - define location for reference data directory
   - with variable create_verification_files you can define if you want to use the existing reference data or if you want first run the data for reference.
   - NOTE that if you choose to run the reference data first, the reference data directory must be somewhere from where you can submit runs

2. Test settings
   - files are named short/medium_test_definitions.sh
   - User can choose which tests are run. At the moment options are Fluctuations and Magnetosphere
   - Define the vlsv file for comparison	
   - In arrays variables_name and variables_component use defines which parameters are compared. 
   - variables_name has the name of the variable and variables_component have the number of the component that is compared 
   - variables_name and variables_component must have same number of elements
   - For example:
      variables_name=( "rho" "rho_v" "rho_v" "rho_v" "B" "B" "B" "E" "E" "E" )
      variables_components=( 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 )
      -> e.g. 1st variable for comparison is variables_name[1] variables_component[1] = rho 0, 
              4th is  variables_name[4] variables_component[4] = rho_v 4


3. Running tests
   - writes the results of the comparison in test.o file
