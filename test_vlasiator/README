README file for running tests with run_tests.sh

To do before running real tests:
-Reference files does not yet have verified results, but after they have been added this should be ready to use.

-Reference directories should have only the last grid-file named grid grid.0000001.vlsv (and the first grid.0000000.vlsv).

-Also the cfg files for test should be changed so that the save only the last vlsv file.

-Only short test is tested at the moment, longer version works probably also if you change the values of p and t and #PBS -l mppwidth=, #PBS -l mppdepth=, so that mppwidth=p and mppdepth=t.

-This version is for meteo.

-vlsvdiff.cpp should be changed so that it does not print the dots after the numbers. Lines 297, 298, 300 and 301, remove dots at the end of the print


Usage:
-in run_tests.sh you can choose which test to run, and the parameters compared in the test
-you can specify the directories for the reference files
